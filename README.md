    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

    
    By compartmentalzing sections, sections can be added, removed, or changed entirely in order to work with different databases. By setting variables and not hard-coding in elements can also equate to better adaptibility for the code. This code can be changed with very little work in order to function with new databases, collections, and connections. By following OOP, this simple and powerful CRUD module can be used in many different types of ways. 
    
   
    
    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

   
    I did quite a few things differently for this project than any that I have done before. I initially wrote pseudocode to help plan what the overall code should achieve then worked from there by breaking it down into smaller "modules". By only focusing on one seciton at a time, I was able to pay better attention to the code that I was writing. This ended up eliminating a ton of headaches during the debug process since I only had to test each piece individually. Running the code within jupyter notebook was also a wonderful tool as I could test all of the components quickly and efficiently. 
   
    
   
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

    
    Computer scientests write programs so tasks can be made easier and quicker. They can design and write code to perform tasks much quicker than a human could by hand and then attach something like a visual UI to it to make even the most basic of users comfortable with the program and its functions. Efficiency is key within the workplace. This type of software enables companies like Grazioso to have the ability to hire workers that may not have as much computer knownledge since a graphical UI is much more straighforward than running python scripts. This type of software also helps to reduce errors, improve efficiency, and can improve decision-making since a lot of the guesswork is taken away.
